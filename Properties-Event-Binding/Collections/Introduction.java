Collections in JavaFX are defined by the javafx.collections package, which consists of the following interfaces and classes:

(1) Interfaces

ObservableList: A list that enables listeners to track changes when they occur

ListChangeListener: An interface that receives notifications of changes to an ObservableList

ObservableMap: A map that enables observers to track changes when they occur

MapChangeListener: An interface that receives notifications of changes to an ObservableMap

(2) Classes

FXCollections: A utility class that consists of static methods that are one-to-one copies of java.util.Collections methods

ListChangeListener.Change: Represents a change made to an ObservableList

MapChangeListener.Change: Represents a change made to an ObservableMap
